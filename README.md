# Grant-database-scraper

Government grants are publicly accessible on https://grants.gov/search-grants for the general public. This simple dynamic web scraper can be very useful by compiling the grants into a database and make it easier to filter using SQL

Adapted from: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/creating-a-sqlite-database-from-csv-with-python/?ref=rp

For use, you need to install lxml package and the database, or run it in google colab
