# Grant-database-scraper

Government grants are accessible on https://grants.gov/search-grants for the general public. This simple dynamic web scraper can be very useful. It works by scraping the xml file containing all governments grants and related info, compiling them into a SQL database and saving it locally. It can easily be explanded for other aplications or adapted by use for a local team. Having all the information in one place can make it easy to run statistical and categorical analysis on it, and filtering specific types of government grants.

For use, you need to install lxml package and the database, or run it in google colab
